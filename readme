Be sure to read readme.rtf too.  This readme only explains functionality that
is specific to the Linux release of Brogue.

---

Brogue now supports remapped keys.  The remapping engine is quite limited
and is described in bin/keymap.

--

./brogue is a shell script that will invoke bin/brogue with the appropriate
switches and in the correct working folder.  It therefore serves as an
acceptable target for a desktop shortcut (see make-link-for-desktop.sh for
an easy way to make one.)  It will pass command line arguments along
to bin/brogue.  The following switches are accepted:

-h                         print a help message
-V                         print the version
--scores                   dump scores to output and exit immediately

-n                         start a new game, skipping the menu
-s seed                    start a new game with the specified numerical seed
-o filename[.broguesave]   open a recording (extension may be omitted)
-v recording[.broguerec]   view a recording (extension may be omitted)
-M                         same as --no-menu

--size N                   starts the game with font size N (1 to 13)
--no-menu                  never display the menu (automatically pick new game)
--noteye-hack              ignore SDL-specific application state checks

--

The following render switches are accepted:

-t	force ncurses-based terminal mode

--

Terminal mode uses as many colors as it has available to it.  If you are using
gnome terminal, you already have 256 color support, but the terminal doesn't
advertise that fact.  Change the TERM environment variable to tell Brogue that
you have more than 16 colors:

export TERM=xterm-256color

Converely, if you are using a terminal that has 256 colors but only want to
use 16:

export TERM=xterm


If you are using xterm, read http://push.cx/2008/256-color-xterms-in-ubuntu

To build, generate the Makefile with premake, then run make:

    premake4 gmake
    make
